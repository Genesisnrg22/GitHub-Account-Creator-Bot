- **Web Browser:** Chrome (latest version recommended)

## üé¨ How to Run the Application
1. Locate the downloaded file from your computer. 
2. If applicable, ensure you have Google Chrome installed, as this application uses it for account creation.
3. Open your command prompt or terminal.

For example, on Windows, you can do this by searching for "cmd" in the start menu.

4. Navigate to the folder where you placed the executable by using the `cd` command. For instance:

   Adjust the filename if it differs in your version.

## üìë Configuration
The tool will ask for some initial information to create your GitHub account, such as:
- Username
- Email
- Password

The application will generate a random password unless you specify one. If you want to use a specific username or email, simply input that when prompted.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues while running the application, consider the following:

- **Python Not Found:** Ensure Python is installed and added to your system PATH.
